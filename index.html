        <h1>Paper Towns</h1>
        <h3>By John Green</h3>
      </div>
      <div id="paragraphs1" class="paragraphs">
        <p>Published October 16, 2008, Paper Towns is a novel by John Green that had an interesting plot. It first starts off with Quentin Jacobsen and Margo Roth Spiegelman as children playing in the park and finding a dead body. Quentin somehow saw this as a bonding moment and has formed a weird crush on Margo that developed into his teens. In fact, it is not even a crush anymore, it is some kind of worshipping. To elaborate, Quentin says specific things like, “My miracle was this .. I ended up living next door to Margo Roth Spiegelman.” (Green 4) On top of that, her full name is always used throughout the book to emphasize it’s sheer importance. In short, Quentin thinks of her like a god.</p>
        <p>Fast forward to their teen years, and you will see that Margo and Quentin are not exactly the friends they were when they were younger. Despite that, Quentin is slightly delusional and thinks that they are still the best of friends. He is almost stalker-like, and describes her slightest features… Anyways, Q also has real best friends: Radar and Ben. Radar is the tech nerd and owns a Wikipedia-esque website that he had created and spends almost every second of his free-time managing it and removing “graffiti”, or false posts that are inaccurate. Ben is a party animal and really enjoys making the most of his time to have fun. Margo’s best friend would have to be Lacey. Although, Margo does not consider her to be her friend.</p>

      <div id="paragraphs2" class="paragraphs">
        <p>With all these interesting friends in mind, they all accompany Q on his search for Margo once she disappears. Long story short, Q finds a bunch of far-off clues that eventually lead him to Margo in Agloe, New York. This is where the book gets it’s name, Agloe is a “paper (or fake) town” that mapmakers put in their maps for copyright purposes. The gang (Q, Ben, Radar, and Lacey) find Margo and she is startled. She tells Q that she never actually wanted to be found and left the last clue as a joke. Margo tries to get Q to come with her but they both part ways because Q has to go back home and Margo “has” to stay in this random city. Then, the book literally describes the scene with her face fading out and everything going dark.</p>
        <p>While this book may have an interesting plot, I disliked the ending and I think it subtracted from the work. Margo is out in New York living like a hobo and she would rather do that than live with her parents and her sister. What?! Margo is, in my view, a spoiled brat with not-so-great parents. But so what? Oh, you have such an awful life Margo, better move five states over and live like a hobo! Yep, that’s way better. On top of that, Q is left behind without even a call from her, letter, email or anything to let him know that she is okay. Q spends his prom and graduation looking for this brat and she doesn't even want to even consider moving back. I just didn’t get it.</p>

          <p>This is an awesome piece of artwork that accurately portrays Q's search for Margo.</p>

          <p>This thumbtack represents one of the most important parts of the story when Q realizes that the holes in the wall belonged to a map.</p>

          <p>This movie poster largely surprised me because I always thought that the characters would look different.</p>
